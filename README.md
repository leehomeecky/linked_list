# linked_list
This is a basic implementation of a singly linked list in C.
The linked list is a dynamic data structure that can be resized as needed. It supports the following operations:

**Create a new, empty linked list**
Destroy a linked list and free all associated memory
Add a new element to the end of a linked list
Remove an element from a linked list
Get the value of an element in a linked list
Set the value of an element in a linked list
To use the linked list implementation, you will need to include the appropriate header file in your C source code. You can then create a new linked list by calling a function that creates an empty list. Once you have a linked list, you can add elements to it, remove elements from the list, get the value of an element, and set the value of an element using appropriate functions.

Finally, when you are finished using the linked list, you can free all associated memory by calling a function that destroys the linked list and frees all memory allocated to it.
